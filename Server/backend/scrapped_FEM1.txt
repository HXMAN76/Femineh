## Diagnosis

Most often, health care providers find out you have chickenpox based on the rash.

Chickenpox also can be confirmed with lab tests, including blood tests or a tissue study of samples of affected skin.

## Treatment

In otherwise healthy children, chickenpox often needs no medical treatment. Some children may be able to take a type of medicine called an antihistamine to calm itching. But for the most part, the disease just needs to run its course.

### If you're at high risk of complications

For people who are at high risk of complications from chickenpox, providers sometimes prescribe medicines to shorten the length of the illness and to help lower the risk of complications.

If you or your child is at high risk of complications, your provider may suggest antiviral medicine to fight the virus, such as acyclovir (Zovirax, Sitavig). This medicine may lessen the symptoms of chickenpox. But they work best when given within 24 hours after the rash first appears.

Other antiviral drugs, such as valacyclovir (Valtrex) and famciclovir, also might make the illness less severe. But these may not be approved or right for everyone. In some cases, your provider may suggest that you get the chickenpox vaccine after you've been exposed to the virus. This can prevent the disease or help make it less severe.

### Treating complications

If you or your child gets complications, your provider will figure out the right treatment. For example, antibiotics can treat infected skin and pneumonia. Brain swelling, also called encephalitis, is often treated with antiviral medicine. Treatment in the hospital may be needed.

## Lifestyle and home remedies

To help ease the symptoms of mild chickenpox, you can follow these self-care tips.

### Try not to scratch

Scratching the skin can cause scarring and slow healing. It also can raise the risk that the sores will get infected. If your child can't stop scratching, trim your child's fingernails. It also may help to put gloves on a child's hands, especially at night.

### Relieve the itch and other symptoms

The chickenpox rash can be very itchy, and broken blisters called vesicles sometimes sting. For relief of these and other symptoms, you can try:

  * A cool bath with added baking soda, aluminum acetate or uncooked oatmeal. Or you could add colloidal oatmeal, a finely ground oatmeal that is made for soaking.
  * Calamine lotion dabbed on the itchy spots.
  * A soft, bland diet if chickenpox sores form in the mouth.
  * Antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) for itching. But ask your provider if your child can safely take antihistamines.
  * Acetaminophen (Tylenol) for a mild fever.



Call your provider if a fever lasts longer than four days and is higher than 102 F (38.9 C). And don't give aspirin to children and teenagers who have chickenpox. This can lead to a serious medical problem called Reye's syndrome.

Talk with your provider before you give any type of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), to someone who has chickenpox. Some studies suggest this type of medicine may lead to skin infections or tissue damage.

## Preparing for your appointment

Call your family health care provider if you or your child has symptoms of chickenpox. Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment.

### Information to gather in advance

  * **Pre-appointment safety measures.** Ask if you or your child should follow any restrictions before the checkup, such as staying away from other people.
  * **Symptom history.** Write down any symptoms you or your child has had, and for how long.
  * **Recent exposure to people who might have had chickenpox.** Try to remember if you or your child has been exposed to anyone who might have had the disease in the last few weeks.
  * **Key medical information.** Include any other health problems and the names of any medicines you or your child is taking.
  * **Questions to ask your provider.** Write down your questions so you can make the most of your time at the checkup.



Questions to ask your provider about chickenpox include:

  * What is the most likely cause of these symptoms?
  * Are there any other possible causes?
  * What treatment do you suggest?
  * How soon before the symptoms get better?
  * Are there home remedies or self-care steps that could help relieve the symptoms?
  * Am I or is my child contagious? For how long?
  * How do we lower the risk of infecting others?



Feel free to ask any other questions.

### What to expect from your doctor

Your provider may ask:

  * What symptoms have you noticed, and when did they first appear?
  * Do you know anyone who has had symptoms of chickenpox within the last few weeks?
  * Have you had or has your child had a chickenpox vaccine? How many doses?
  * Are you or is your child being treated? Or have you recently been treated for other medical problems?
  * Do you or your child take any medicines, vitamins or supplements?
  * Is your child in school or child care?
  * Are you pregnant or breastfeeding?



### What you can do in the meantime

Rest as much as possible. Try not to touch skin with chickenpox on it. And think about wearing a face mask over the nose and mouth in public. Chickenpox is highly contagious until skin blisters have fully crusted.

#  Chickenpox 

## Definition

Chickenpox is a viral infection in which a person develops very itchy blisters all over the body. It was more common in the past. The illness is rare today because of the chickenpox vaccine.

## Alternative Names

Varicella; Chicken pox

## Causes

Chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus. It is a member of the herpesvirus family. The same virus also causes shingles in adults.

Chickenpox can be spread very easily to others from 1 to 2 days before blisters appear until all the blisters have crusted over. You may get chickenpox:

  * From touching the fluids from a chickenpox blister
  * If someone with the disease coughs or sneezes near you



Most cases of chickenpox occur in children younger than age 10. The disease is most often mild, although serious complications may occur. Adults and older children get sicker than younger children in most cases.

Children whose mothers have had chickenpox or have received the chickenpox vaccine are not very likely to catch it before they are 1 year old. If they do catch chickenpox, they often have mild cases. This is because antibodies from their mothers' blood help protect them. Children under 1 year old whose mothers have not had chickenpox or the vaccine can get severe chickenpox.

Severe chickenpox symptoms are more common in children whose immune system does not work well.

## Symptoms

Most children with chickenpox have the following symptoms before the rash appears:

  * Fever
  * Headache
  * Stomach ache



The chickenpox rash occurs about 10 to 21 days after coming into contact with someone who had the disease. In most cases, a child will develop 250 to 500 small, itchy, fluid-filled blisters over red spots on the skin.

  * The blisters are most often first seen on the face, middle of the body, or scalp.
  * After a day or two, the blisters become cloudy and then scab. Meanwhile, new blisters form in groups. They often appear in the mouth, in the vagina, and on the eyelids.
  * Children with skin problems, such as eczema, may get thousands of blisters.



Most pox will not leave scars unless they become infected with bacteria from scratching.

Some children who have had the vaccine will still develop a mild case of chickenpox. In most cases, they recover much more quickly and have only a few poxes (fewer than 30). These cases are often harder to diagnose. However, these children can still spread chickenpox to others.

## Exams and Tests

Your health care provider can most often diagnose chickenpox by looking at the rash and asking questions about the person's medical history. Small blisters on the scalp confirm the diagnosis in most cases.

Lab tests can help confirm the diagnosis, if needed.

## Treatment

Treatment involves keeping the person as comfortable as possible. Here are things to try:

  * Avoid scratching or rubbing the itchy areas. Keep fingernails short to avoid damaging the skin from scratching.
  * Wear cool, light, loose bedclothes. Avoid wearing rough clothing, particularly wool, over an itchy area.
  * Take lukewarm baths using little soap and rinse thoroughly. Try a skin-soothing oatmeal or cornstarch bath.
  * Apply a soothing moisturizer after bathing to soften and cool the skin.
  * Avoid prolonged exposure to excessive heat and humidity.
  * Try over-the-counter oral antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), but be aware of possible side effects, such as drowsiness.
  * Try over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream on itchy areas. 



Medicines that fight the chickenpox virus are available, but not given to everyone. To work well, the medicine should be started within the first 24 hours of the rash.

  * Antiviral drugs are not very often prescribed to otherwise healthy children who do not have severe symptoms. Adults and teens, who are at risk for more severe symptoms, may benefit from antiviral medicine if it is given early.
  * Antiviral medicine may be very important for those who have skin conditions (such as eczema or recent sunburn), lung conditions (such as asthma), or who have recently taken steroids.
  * Some providers also give antiviral medicines to people in the same household who also develop chickenpox, because they will most often develop more severe symptoms. 



DO NOT give aspirin or ibuprofen to someone who may have chickenpox. Use of aspirin has been associated with a serious condition called Reye syndrome. Ibuprofen has been associated with more severe secondary infections. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) may be used.

A child with chickenpox should not return to school or play with other children until all chickenpox sores have crusted over or dried out. Adults should follow this same rule while considering when to return to work or be around others.

## Outlook (Prognosis)

In most cases, a person recovers without complications.

Once you have had chickenpox, the virus often remains dormant or asleep in your body for your lifetime. About 1 in 10 adults will have shingles when the virus re-emerges during a period of stress.

## Possible Complications

Rarely, infection of the brain has occurred. Other problems may include:

  * Reye syndrome 
  * Infection of the heart muscle
  * Pneumonia
  * Joint pain or swelling



Cerebellar ataxia may appear during the recovery phase or later. This involves a very unsteady walk.

Women who get chickenpox during pregnancy can pass the infection to the developing baby. Newborns are at risk for severe infection.

## When to Contact a Medical Professional

Contact your provider if you think that your child has chickenpox or if your child is over 12 months of age and has not been vaccinated against chickenpox.

## Prevention

Because chickenpox is airborne and spreads very easily, even before the rash appears, it is hard to avoid.

A vaccine to prevent chickenpox is part of a child's routine vaccine schedule.

The vaccine often prevents the chickenpox disease completely or makes the illness very mild.

Talk to your provider if you think your child might be at high risk for complications and might have been exposed. Taking preventive steps right away may be important. Giving the vaccine early after exposure may still reduce the severity of the disease.

## About chickenpox

Chickenpox (also known as varicella) is a highly infectious viral infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus. 

It usually causes mild illness but can reappear later in life as [shingles](/health/conditionsandtreatments/shingles). Newborn babies, pregnant women and people with a weakened [immune system](/conditionsandtreatments/immune-system) are at increased risk of serious illness. 

Anyone who has not had chickenpox or who has not been [vaccinated against chickenpox](/health/healthyliving/chickenpox-immunisation) is at risk of infection. 

## Symptoms of chickenpox 

Symptoms of chickenpox can occur within 2 to 3 weeks after exposure to the virus. 

Symptoms can include: 

  * low-grade [fever](/health/conditionsandtreatments/fever)
  * [headache](/health/conditionsandtreatments/headache)
  * runny nose
  * sore throat
  * feeling generally unwell
  * skin rash.



The rash usually begins with small lumps that turn into blisters, which burst and eventually scab over after about 5 days. The rash can affect the body, limbs and head, including the mouth, eyelids or genital area. The rash is usually itchy and can potentially lead to scarring.

Most people with chickenpox have a mild, self-limiting illness, especially people who have been vaccinated against chickenpox. Chickenpox tends to be more severe in adults than children. 

Some people can have serious illness with complications such as: 

  * [cellulitis](/health/conditionsandtreatments/cellulitis) – infection and inflammation of the skin 
  * [pneumonia](/health/conditionsandtreatments/pneumonia) – infection and inflammation of the lungs 
  * [hepatitis](/health/conditionsandtreatments/hepatitis) – inflammation of the liver
  * [encephalitis](/health/conditionsandtreatments/viral-encephalitis) – inflammation of the brain
  * very rarely, chickenpox can be fatal. 



People who have previously had chickenpox can develop shingles later in life.

## Chickenpox and shingles

For some infected people, the varicella-zoster virus that causes chickenpox can reappear later in life to cause [shingles](/health/conditionsandtreatments/shingles). After causing chickenpox, the virus becomes inactive in the nerve cells of the body. When it reactivates it can cause shingles. 

Symptoms of shingles include a painful rash that blisters. Anti-viral medication and pain medication may be required to treat shingles.

One in 3 adults who have had chickenpox will develop shingles in their lifetime. The incidence and severity of shingles increases with age.

People with shingles should avoid contact with others, especially people at increased risk of serious illness from chickenpox. People who do not have immunity against chickenpox can become infected with chickenpox (not shingles) if they come into contact with the fluid in the blisters of a person with shingles.

## How chickenpox spreads

Chickenpox is spread from person-to-person by: 

  * breathing in very small droplets that contain the virus which is breathed out by an infected person, such as from coughing or sneezing 
  * touching the fluid in the blisters of an infected person. Blisters that have scabbed do not spread infection. 



People with chickenpox are infectious from 2 days before the onset of the rash until all the blisters have scabbed.

## Chickenpox in pregnancy

Most pregnant women have immunity against chickenpox. However, some pregnant women can become infected and have serious illness. Complications include pneumonia, hepatitis and encephalitis. 

Chickenpox in pregnant women can lead to birth abnormalities in the baby. These include abnormalities of the skin, arms and legs, eyes, brain and potentially other parts of the body. The risk is highest during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. 

There is also the risk of the newborn baby developing chickenpox and other complications. 

If you are planning a pregnancy you should speak to your doctor to review your vaccination status and check your immunity with a blood test. 

If you do not have immunity against chickenpox you are recommended to take precautions:

  * If you are not pregnant, you should be vaccinated before becoming pregnant. Two doses of chickenpox vaccine are recommended and should be given at least 4 weeks apart. 
  * If you are pregnant and not immune you should avoid contact with people with chickenpox. Pregnant women cannot receive the chickenpox vaccine. If you are exposed to chickenpox, contact your doctor, midwife or hospital as soon as possible, as an injection of varicella-zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) may be recommended.



## Diagnosis of chickenpox 

Chickenpox is usually diagnosed by your doctor, with laboratory testing of a sample of the blister fluid to help confirm the diagnosis.

A blood test can also be done to check for immunity against chickenpox. 

## Treatment of chickenpox 

For most people, chickenpox causes mild illness that gets better without specific treatment. You can relieve symptoms and prevent complications by: 

  * resting
  * drinking plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration
  * using paracetamol to bring down fevers
  * using creams or lotions, such as calamine lotion, to reduce the itching – if you have a skin condition such as [eczema](/health/conditionsandtreatments/eczema-atopic-dermatitis) ask your doctor or pharmacist about other available creams 
  * wearing mittens to prevent scratching – these can be worn by babies and young children
  * having colloidal oatmeal baths may also help reduce itching.



People with serious illness may need treatment with antiviral medication and hospital admission. 

## Prevention of chickenpox 

People with chickenpox should avoid contact with other people, particularly those at increased risk of serious illness, such as newborn babies, pregnant women and people with a weakened immune system.

[Children with chickenpox must not go to school, kindergarten or childcare until all blisters have scabbedExternal Link ](https://www.health.vic.gov.au/infectious-diseases/school-exclusion-table). Parents, guardians or carers should inform the school, kindergarten or childcare centre as testing and treatment may be recommended for workers and other children.

Chickenpox can be prevented through [vaccination](/health/healthyliving/chickenpox-immunisation). Two doses of vaccine (varicella-containing vaccine) are recommended. Vaccination helps protect against infection and serious illness. 

### Chickenpox vaccination for children under 14 years of age 

In Australia, all children under 14 years of age are recommended to receive 2 doses of a varicella-containing vaccine.

  * The first dose is available free of charge under the [National Immunisation Program ScheduleExternal Link ](https://www.health.gov.au/topics/immunisation/when-to-get-vaccinated/national-immunisation-program-schedule) (NIP). It is given at 18 months of age as part of the combination MMRV (measles, mumps, rubella and varicella) vaccine. The MMRV vaccine can be given safely in children who have already had chickenpox infection prior to 18 months of age.
  * The second dose is available by private prescription. Parents, guardians or carers can arrange the second dose through their doctor or immunisation provider. The second dose should be given at least 4 weeks after the first dose.



Immunised children who get chickenpox (known as breakthrough chickenpox) generally have a much milder form of the disease. They have fewer skin lesions, a lower fever and recover more quickly.

### Chickenpox vaccination for adolescents aged 14 years and over and adults 

Adolescents aged 14 years and over and adults are recommended to receive 2 doses of vaccine. The 2 doses should be given at least 4 weeks apart. The combination MMRV vaccine is not recommended for people aged 14 years and over. 

People who have previously been infected with chickenpox or who have blood tests showing evidence of immunity may not require vaccination. 

Free [catch-up vaccination](/health/healthyliving/immunisations-catch-ups-and-boosters) is available under the NIP for all eligible people under the age of 20 years, and refugees, asylum seekers and humanitarian entrants of any age. The first dose is funded under the NIP for eligible people. Other non-immune people aged 20 years and over require a private prescription. 

### Chickenpox vaccination for specified occupations 

People who work in healthcare, childhood education and childcare, or long term-care facilities are strongly recommended to have 2 doses of chickenpox vaccine if they are not immune.

For further information, see your doctor or immunisation provider.

## How we can protect our community from chickenpox 

High levels of vaccination in the community can prevent the spread of chickenpox and protect people in the community who cannot be vaccinated, such as those who are too young or too unwell. This is called [herd immunity](/health/healthyliving/Immunisation-common-questions). 

Children with chickenpox must not go to school, kindergarten or childcare centres until all blisters have dried.

You can look after your own family and protect vulnerable people in your community by:

  * ensuring you and your family are fully vaccinated 
  * keeping children with chickenpox home from school, kindergarten or childcare until all blisters have scabbed. 
  * if you or a family member has chickenpox or shingles, avoiding contact with other people, particularly those at increased risk of serious illness, such as newborn babies, pregnant women and people with a weakened immune system.



While the number of chickenpox infections have decreased with widespread vaccination through the NIP, chickenpox is highly infectious. 

In Victoria, chickenpox is a notifiable condition that is reported by doctors to the Department of Health. 

People who are exposed to chickenpox and are not immune may be given treatment to reduce their risk of infection and serious illness through:

  * vaccination within 5 days of exposure 
  * an injection of varicella-zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) for people with an increased risk of serious illness, usually within 4 days (96 hours) of exposure, but can be given as late as 10 days after exposure.

## What are chickenpox and shingles tests?

Chickenpox and shingles tests check to see if you are or have ever been infected with the varicella zoster virus (VZV). VZV is a type of [herpes](https://medlineplus.gov/herpessimplex.html) virus that causes [chickenpox](https://medlineplus.gov/chickenpox.html) and [shingles](https://medlineplus.gov/shingles.html). This virus is also known as human herpesvirus 3 (HHV-3) and the herpes zoster virus. The first time you are infected with this virus, you get chickenpox. Once you have had chickenpox, you can't get it again. The virus stays in some of your nerve cells but is dormant (inactive). Later in life, the virus can become active again and cause shingles. Unlike chickenpox, you can get shingles more than once, but it is rare. A shingles infection is sometimes also called herpes zoster.

Testing for VZV involves checking for VZV in a blood, fluid, or tissue sample. There are different types of tests to do this:

  * **A[PCR](https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/pcr-tests/) (polymerase chain reaction) test.** This test looks for genetic material from VZV in a sample. It is most often done on a sample of fluid taken by swabbing open blisters (a swab test). In some cases, other fluids may be used, but the results may not always be as accurate. The PCR test can get results quickly and is the most useful test for confirming a VZV infection.
  * **A viral culture test.** For this test, cells from a swab test sample are grown in a lab and then checked for VZV. This test is not as accurate as a PCR test.
  * **A direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) test.** This test is also done on a swab test sample that is sent to a lab. It involves using a fluorescent dye and a special microscope to look for VZV in the sample. It is a rapid test, but it is not as accurate as a PCR.
  * **An antibody test.** This is a blood test that looks for VZV antibodies. Antibodies are proteins that your immune system makes to fight foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria. Testing for one type of antibody (IgM) can show if you have a current or recent VZV infection. Testing for another type of antibody (IgG) can show if you have ever been exposed to VZV.



Which tests and samples are used depends on the person and their symptoms.

Other names: varicella zoster virus antibody, serum varicella immunoglobulin G antibody level, VZV antibodies IgG and IgM, herpes zoster

## What are they used for?

Health care providers can usually diagnose chickenpox or shingles with a visual examination. But in some cases, your provider may also order a chickenpox or shingles test to confirm the diagnosis.

These tests are also sometimes ordered to check for immunity to the varicella zoster virus (VZV). You have immunity if you've had chickenpox before or have had the chickenpox [vaccine](https://medlineplus.gov/vaccines.html). When you have immunity, it means you can't get chickenpox. But you can still get shingles later in life.

These tests may be done on people who are at higher risk of complications from VZV and either don't have immunity or don't know if they have immunity. People who are at higher risk of complications include:

  * [Pregnant](https://medlineplus.gov/infectionsandpregnancy.html) people
  * Infants
  * Teen and adults with symptoms of chickenpox
  * People who have weakened [immune systems](https://medlineplus.gov/immunesystemanddisorders.html), for example, because they: 
    * Have [HIV](https://medlineplus.gov/hiv.html), cancer, or another condition that weakens their immune system
    * Have had an [organ transplant](https://medlineplus.gov/organtransplantation.html)
    * Are taking medicines that weaken the immune system, such as [chemotherapy](https://medlineplus.gov/cancerchemotherapy.html) and [steroids](https://medlineplus.gov/steroids.html)



## Why do I need a chickenpox or shingles test?

You may need a chickenpox or shingles test if you are at higher risk of complications, are not immune to VZV, and/or have symptoms of infection.

Contact your provider right away if you have symptoms of chickenpox or shingles. Some of the symptoms of chickenpox and shingles are similar, but they are not the same illness. Common symptoms for both include:

  * A red, [blistering](https://medlineplus.gov/blisters.html) [rash](https://medlineplus.gov/rashes.html)
  * [Fever](https://medlineplus.gov/fever.html)
  * [Headache](https://medlineplus.gov/headache.html)
  * [Sore throat](https://medlineplus.gov/sorethroat.html)



With **chickenpox** , the rash first appears on the chest, back, and face. Then it spreads over the entire body, including inside the mouth, eyelids, or genital area. It usually takes about 1 week for all of the blisters to become scabs.

One to two days before you get the rash, you may have other typical symptoms, such as:

  * Fever
  * Tiredness
  * Loss of appetite
  * Headache



Some people who have been vaccinated against chickenpox can still get the disease. But they often have milder symptoms and are sick for a shorter period of time than people who are not vaccinated.

Before getting a rash, people with **shingles** may first have pain, itching, or tingling in the area where the rash later develops. This can happen several days before the rash appears. They may also have a fever at this time.

The rash that develops is painful and itchy, and it often develops on just one side of the body or face, and in a small area. The most common place for shingles to occur is in a band around one side of the waistline. Shingles on the face can affect the eye and cause vision loss. Rarely, the rash can be more widespread on the body and look similar to a chickenpox rash. This usually happens in people with weakened immune systems.

The rash consists of blisters that typically scab over in 7 to 10 days and fully clear up within 2 to 4 weeks.

Other symptoms of shingles can include:

  * Headache
  * Chills
  * Upset stomach



You may also need this test if you are at higher risk of complications and were recently exposed to chickenpox or shingles. You can't catch shingles from another person. But the shingles virus (VZV) can spread and cause chickenpox in someone who doesn't have immunity.

## What happens during chickenpox and shingles testing?

You will need to provide a sample of blood from your vein or from the fluid in one of your blisters. Blood tests check for antibodies to the VZV. Blister tests check for the virus itself.

**For a blood test from a vein** , a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out.

**For a blister test** , a provider will gently press a cotton swab on a blister to collect a sample of fluid for testing.

Both tests are quick, each usually taking less than five minutes.

## Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?

You don't need any special preparations for a blood or blister test.

## Are there any risks to the test?

After a blood test, you may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. There is no risk to having a blister test.

## What do the results mean?

**If you have symptoms and your test results show VZV antibodies or the virus itself** , it's likely you have chickenpox or shingles. Your diagnosis of either chickenpox or shingles will depend on your age and specific symptoms.

**If you don't have symptoms and your results show antibodies to the virus or the virus itself** , you either had chickenpox at one point or received the chickenpox vaccine.

If you are diagnosed with an infection and are in a high-risk group, your provider may prescribe antiviral medicines. Early treatment can prevent serious and painful complications.

Most healthy children and adults with chickenpox will recover from chickenpox within a week or two. Home treatment can help relieve symptoms. More serious cases may be treated with antiviral medicines. Shingles may also be treated with antiviral medicines as well as pain relievers.

If you have questions about your results or your child's results, talk to your provider.

Learn more about [laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results](https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/how-to-understand-your-lab-results/).

## Is there anything else I need to know about chickenpox and shingles tests?

The best way to prevent chickenpox is to get the chickenpox vaccine. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the chickenpox vaccine for children, teens, and adults who never had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine:

  * For children: 
    * The first dose is recommended at 12 through 15 months old
    * The second dose is recommended at 4 through 6 years old



People 13 years of age and older who have never had chickenpox and haven't had a chickenpox vaccine should get two doses, at least 28 days apart

There is also a vaccine for shingles. It's called Shingrix. The CDC recommends that healthy adults age 50 and older get two doses of Shingrix, separated by 2 to 6 months. Shingrix is also recommended for adults 19 years and older who have weakened immune systems due to disease or medicines. The vaccine provides strong protection against shingles and complications from the disease.

Since you can get shingles more than once, you should get the vaccine even if you've already had shingles.

A different shingles vaccine called Zostavax is no longer available in the United States. If you had a Zostavax vaccine in the past, you should still get vaccinated with Shingrix. Talk to your provider about the best time to get Shingrix.

# Laboratory Testing for Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV)

## Key points

  * This varicella-zoster virus (VZV) laboratory testing information applies to testing and diagnosis of primary VZV infection (varicella) and reactivation (herpes zoster). 
  * Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the most helpful laboratory test for confirming cases of varicella and herpes zoster. 
  * The CDC Herpesvirus Laboratory can provide several types of VZV-specific testing. 



![This photomicrograph reveals the intranuclear inclusions produced by the varicella-zoster virus grown in a tissue culture; Magnified 500X.](/chickenpox/images/disease_varicella-lg.jpg)

## Overview

Laboratory testing can be useful, particularly in cases with less typical clinical presentations.

Testing is recommended to:

  * Confirm suspected cases of varicella. 
  * Confirm varicella as the cause of outbreaks. 
  * Confirm varicella in severe cases (hospitalizations or deaths) or unusual cases. 
  * Determine susceptibility to varicella. 
  * Determine if suspected vaccine-related adverse events were caused by vaccine-strain VZV. 



## Resource lab

**CDC Herpesvirus Laboratory****:**

The CDC Herpesvirus Laboratory can provide several types of VZV-specific testing free-of-charge to state and local public health departments who require confirmatory evidence for VZV infection or confirmation of atypical herpes zoster cases. The laboratory also conducts free testing for physicians and scientists participating in various epidemiologic and laboratory-based studies.

Specimens can also be submitted for suspected vaccine-related adverse events, including:

  * Rash occurring 7 to 42 days after vaccination 
  * Suspected secondary transmission of the vaccine virus 
  * Herpes zoster in a vaccinated person 
  * Any serious adverse event 



For more information on VZV specimen collection, storage, and handling, please contact the CDC Herpesvirus Laboratory.

## Types of tests

### Testing recommendations for varicella‎

A visual tool that summarizes what test types are available and when to collect specimens for testing measles, mumps, rubella, & varicella.

[See tool](https://www.cdc.gov/chickenpox/downloads/MMRV-Testing-for-Clinicians.pdf)

### Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)

PCR is the most useful laboratory test for confirming suspected varicella and herpes zoster. PCR can detect VZV DNA rapidly and sensitively in skin lesions (vesicles, scabs, maculopapular lesions).

#### Specimens for PCR testing

  * Vesicular lesions or scabs, if present, are the best for sampling. 
  * Adequate collection of specimens from maculopapular lesions in vaccinated people can be a challenge.
    * However, one study[1](#cdcreference_1) that compares a variety of specimens from the same patients vaccinated with one dose suggests that maculopapular lesions collected with proper technique are a highly reliable specimen types for the detection of VZV. 
  * Other sources, such as nasopharyngeal secretions, saliva, urine, bronchial washings, and cerebrospinal fluid are less likely to provide an adequate sample; they often lead to false negative results. 



### DFA tests, viral culture, and Tzanck smears

Other viral isolation techniques for the confirmation of varicella are direct fluorescent antibody assay (DFA) and viral culture. However, these techniques are generally not recommended because they are less sensitive than PCR. In the case of viral culture, these techniques take longer to generate results.

Like DFA, a Tzanck smear has a rapid turnaround time but is not recommended because of its limited sensitivity and is not specific for VZV. Moreover, real-time PCR protocols can be completed within one day.

### Serologic tests

Serologic methods have limited use for laboratory confirmation of herpes zoster and should only be used when suitable specimens for PCR testing are not available.

IgM serologic testing is considerably less sensitive than PCR testing of skin lesions. IgM serology provides evidence for a recent active VZV infection. However, it cannot distinguish between primary infection and reinfection or reactivation from latency. This is because specific IgM antibodies are produced with each exposure to VZV. IgM tests are also inherently prone to poor specificity.

#### Specimens for serologic testing

Measuring acute and convalescent sera also has limited value, since it is difficult to detect an increase in IgG for laboratory diagnosis of herpes zoster.

Paired acute and convalescent sera showing a four-fold rise in IgG antibodies have excellent specificity for varicella. However, they are not as sensitive as PCR of skin lesions for the diagnosis of varicella. People with a prior history of vaccination or disease may have very high baseline titers and may not achieve a four-fold increase in the convalescent sera. The usefulness of this method for diagnosing varicella is further limited as it requires two office visits. A single positive IgG ELISA result cannot confirm a varicella case.

## Laboratory guidelines

[Expand All](#)

##  Laboratory criteria for diagnosis

  * The preferred diagnosis method is a demonstration of VZV DNA by PCR tests from a clinical specimen, ideally scabs, vesicular fluid, or cells from the base of a lesion. 
  * PCR is also useful for confirming breakthrough varicella. Other methods, such as DFA and culture, are available for diagnosis but are less sensitive and specific than PCR. 
  * Positive serologic test for varicella-zoster immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody when a varicella-like rash is present. 
  * Four-fold or greater rise in serum varicella immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody titer by any standard serologic assay between acute and convalescent sera. 



For both unvaccinated and vaccinated people, PCR is the most reliable method for confirming a VZV infection.

## Specimen collection

Learn about guidelines for collecting and shipping specimens for VZV testing (varicella and herpes zoster). These include methods for VZV serologic assays and VZV PCR/genotyping, sources for suitable supplies, and how to submit specimen to CDC.

**Keep Reading:** [Specimen Collection for VZV Testing](/chickenpox/php/laboratories/collecting-vzv-specimens.html)

## Virus strain identification

PCR testing and genotyping can distinguish between wild-type VZV and vaccine-type (Oka/Merck) strains of VZV. 

Such testing is used in situations when it is important to recognize the two VZV strains, like in suspected vaccine adverse events. Examples of possible varicella vaccine-adverse events include: 

  * Varicella or a varicella-related complication in a vaccinated person 7 to 42 days after vaccination. 
  * Herpes zoster in a vaccinated person. 
  * Suspected secondary vaccine-strain VZV transmission. 



Samples of blood, cerebrospinal fluid, biopsy, or autopsy specimens may also be tested for vaccine-strain/wild-type VZV discrimination to confirm etiology and to identify a vaccine-adverse event. However, these specimens and can lead to false negative results.

### Specialized labs‎

The CDC Herpesvirus Laboratory and APHL Vaccine Preventable Diseases Reference Centers can distinguish wild-type VZV from Oka strain using both strain differential real-time PCR and PCR combined with restriction fragment length polymorphism. Each center (WI, CA, NY, MN) receives specimens from designated states.

[See quick reference guide](https://www.aphl.org/programs/infectious_disease/Pages/VPD.aspx)

### Evaluating VZV susceptibility

#### IgG ELISA

A single serologic IgG test can determine if a person has antibodies to VZV from past varicella disease or who may be candidates for varicella-zoster immune globulin (VZIG). The product available in the United States is VariZIG. 

Commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) are the recommendation for screening. Whole infected cell (wc) ELISA is the most commonly used test to determine if a person has antibodies to VZV from past varicella disease. Wc ELISA taken from blood samples can readily detect seroconversion to natural infection with VZV. 

Routine testing for varicella immunity following vaccination is unnecessary because commercially available VZV IgG assays are not sensitive enough to detect all seroconversions after a vaccination.

The more sensitive purified glycoprotein ELISA (gpELISA) has been used in research settings to detect seroconversion after vaccination. However, testing with gpELISA is not available commercially.

#### IgG avidity

IgG avidity in research settings determines if a person who is IgG positive for VZV was infected with the virus in the past or more recently. 

The laboratory at CDC developed an IgG avidity assay, which determines if the most recent VZV rash was due to primary infection (varicella) or reactivation (herpes zoster). 

  * **High avidity** is an indicator of a remote infection. 
  * **Low avidity** is an indicator of VZV primary infection. 



People infected in the past tend to have antibodies with a high affinity for binding to the antigen. People with a more recent infection tend to have a low affinity.

Vaccinated people undergo antibody affinity maturation following vaccination, which leads to moderate to high IgG avidity VZV antibody. Measurements of VZV avidity in vaccinated people are unlikely to distinguish remote infection (or vaccination) from recent (breakthrough) infection with VZV. This test is not available commercially.

### Establishing lab evidence of immunity to varicella

#### IgG ELISA

A positive IgG ELISA result indicates that a person has antibodies to VZV from past varicella disease or vaccination. This test cannot distinguish whether the antibodies were from a past episode of varicella or vaccination.

While many commercial VZV IgG ELISAs perform well enough to detect seroconversion for infection by wild-type viruses, the performance specifications (specificity and sensitivity) of these methods vary widely.

#### IgG assays

Some commercially available VZV IgG assays are unreliable, even for detecting a natural disease history in people. Currently, commercial VZV IgG methods sensitive and specific enough to reliably detect seroconversion to the vaccine are unavailable.

# Chickenpox

Chickenpox, also called varicella-zoster, produces a red rash that blisters, then scabs over. It’s very contagious and spreads through bodily fluids and bodily contact. You can prevent chickenpox with a vaccine.

## Overview

![Chickenpox is a contagious virus that causes an extremely itchy rash.](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/-/scassets/images/org/health/articles/chickenpox)Chickenpox, an infectious disease, produces a blister-like rash.

### What is chickenpox?

Chickenpox is an infection that causes an itchy, blister-like skin rash. A virus called varicella-zoster causes it. Chickenpox is highly contagious. But it’s much less common today because there’s a [vaccine](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/24135-vaccines) that protects you from it. Children are the most susceptible to getting chickenpox, although you can get it as an adult, too.

Before the availability of the first vaccine against chickenpox in 1995, almost everyone got chickenpox as a toddler or young child. But since the late 1990s, the rate of chickenpox has declined by nearly 90%. Today, most children receive a vaccine against chickenpox as part of their routine [immunization schedule](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/11288-childhood-immunization-schedule).

Once you’ve had chickenpox, you won’t catch it again from another person. If you’re not vaccinated, you can get chickenpox at any age. Adults who get chickenpox may become very sick, so it’s better to have chickenpox when you’re a child or prevent getting it by receiving the vaccine.

#### What are the three stages of chickenpox?

The three stages of chickenpox usually refer to the way the rash looks:

  * Stage 1 is a red and bumpy rash. This can last a few days.
  * Stage 2 is a fluid-filled blistered rash. The blisters break open after about one to two days.
  * Stage 3 is when the blisters scab over. This stage also lasts a few days.



Even though the rash goes through three stages, you could have all types of bumps at the same time. This means some bumps can be forming while others are already breaking open. The entire rash can last up to about 10 days.

#### Where does chickenpox usually start?

You usually start getting chickenpox on your face and trunk (your chest and your back). From there, it spreads to the rest of your body all the way to your fingers and toes.

#### What age will you get chickenpox?

Now that there’s a vaccine to prevent chickenpox, most children in the U.S. don’t get chickenpox. But in those who aren’t vaccinated, it’s more common to get it between the ages of 3 and 6.

### Why is chickenpox rare now?

Chickenpox isn’t as common as it once was because the [chickenpox vaccine](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/22136-chickenpox-vaccine) has greatly reduced the number of cases.

## Symptoms and Causes

### What are the symptoms of chickenpox?

Chickenpox symptoms are easy to see. Healthcare providers often can look at your child’s skin and know if they have chickenpox. Symptoms of chickenpox usually happen in the following order:

  * Low-grade fever.
  * Feeling tired.
  * Headache.
  * A stomachache that makes you not want to eat.
  * A skin rash that’s very itchy and looks like many small blisters.
  * Bumps filled with a liquid that looks like milky water.
  * Scabs after the blisters break.
  * Skin that looks blotchy.
  * Crusty spots that fade away.



Children who’ve been vaccinated against chickenpox are usually protected against getting chicken pox. But the vaccine isn’t 100% effective, and some children will have a “breakthrough” infection despite being vaccinated. The good news is that these “breakthrough” infections are usually very mild.

### What causes chickenpox?

A virus causes chickenpox. Viruses spread when a person with the virus gives it to another person either through bodily fluid (coughing, sneezing, etc.) or bodily contact (touching the rash).

#### How does chickenpox spread?

Children can get chickenpox at any age. After exposure to chickenpox, your child may appear to be fine for one to three weeks before feeling sick. Children can spread the virus from one to two days before they show any signs of illness until all the blisters have crusted over or scabbed.

Chickenpox spreads by:

  * Coming in contact with someone who has chickenpox.
  * Breathing air from an infected person who sneezes or coughs.
  * Coming in contact with fluids from an infected child's eyes, nose or mouth.



#### Who is at risk for chickenpox?

You’re at risk for getting chickenpox if you didn’t receive the vaccine and haven’t ever had it. Your risk is even higher if you’re around children or work in a school or daycare facility.

### What complications are possible with chickenpox?

Complications from chickenpox are unlikely but possible. They may include:

  * [Bacterial infections](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24189-bacterial-infection) of your skin, blood and soft tissues.
  * [Encephalitis](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/6058-encephalitis) or [Reye’s syndrome](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/6088-reyes-syndrome).
  * [Pneumonia](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4471-pneumonia).
  * [Dehydration](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/9013-dehydration).
  * Issues with how your [blood clots](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/16788-blood-clotting-disorders-hypercoagulable-states).
  * [Liver](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21481-liver) problems.



Even when chickenpox was prevalent, healthy children generally had mild cases of chickenpox. But chickenpox can cause more serious symptoms in adults over 18.

#### Who is more likely to have complications from chickenpox?

Healthy children who get chickenpox don’t usually have serious complications. However, having a severe case of chickenpox could be more dangerous for:

Advertisement

  * Babies whose birth parent didn’t have chickenpox or the vaccine.
  * Pregnant people who didn’t have chickenpox.
  * Anyone over 18.
  * People with [immune system](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21196-immune-system) disorders.
  * People with [cancer](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/12194-cancer-overview) or [HIV](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4251-aids--hiv).
  * People undergoing [chemotherapy](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/24323-chemotherapy-drugs).
  * People who had an [organ transplant](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/11750-organ-donation-and-transplantation).



#### Can chickenpox be fatal?

It’s very unlikely that you’ll die from chickenpox. Most people recover without complications. Of those who die from chickenpox, most people are adults. In 2022, there were fewer than 30 deaths from chickenpox in the U.S. and fewer than 1,400 hospitalizations.

## Diagnosis and Tests

### How is chickenpox diagnosed?

Signs of chickenpox are easy to see. Healthcare providers often can look at your child’s skin and know if they have chickenpox.

## Management and Treatment

### How can I help my child with chickenpox?

Make sure your child gets plenty of rest and fluids. Chickenpox will go away on its own in a week or two. To help your child feel less itchy, you can:

  * Press a cool, moist rag on the rash.
  * Keep your child cool.
  * Encourage your child not to scratch. Trim their fingernails so they can't scratch.
  * Put a lotion with antihistamines on the rash. These lotions are available at the drugstore. If you don't know what to buy, ask the pharmacist for help.
  * Give your child an over-the-counter (OTC) form of antihistamine. Diphenhydramine (Benadryl®) and cetirizine (Zyrtec®) are two examples of OTC [antihistamines](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/21223-antihistamines).
  * Give your child a cool bath or shower every day. You can also give your child an oatmeal bath. When you’re drying them off, don’t rub them with the towel. Instead, pat your child dry.
  * Give your child plenty of water and fluids to prevent dehydration. A soft, bland diet can help if they have blisters in their mouth.

**Don't give your child aspirin**. Aspirin can harm children who have fevers. If your child needs a pain reliever, use acetaminophen (such as Tylenol®). If you’re not sure what product to use, ask your child’s healthcare provider.

#### What if my baby gets chickenpox?

If your baby (up to age 3 months) gets chickenpox, let your child’s healthcare provider know right away. Chickenpox is more dangerous to newborns than to other healthy people.

#### What is the treatment for adults with chickenpox?

The treatment for adults is the same as for children. But your healthcare provider may recommend an [antiviral medication](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/21531-antivirals). Adults who are at risk for severe symptoms or who have certain medical conditions may benefit from antiviral drugs.

### How long is chickenpox contagious?

Chickenpox is contagious until all bumps on your body are scabs. If you have any fluid-filled blisters that haven’t broken or scabbed over, you’re still able to spread the virus.

### How many days does it take to recover from chickenpox?

Chickenpox usually goes away after 10 to 14 days.

## Prevention

### Can my child get a shot to prevent chickenpox?

Yes, there’s a vaccine for chickenpox. Your child’s pediatrician will give it in two doses.

When your child is under the age of 13, they should get one dose between ages 12 months and 15 months. The second dose happens between the ages of 4 and 6. Most children receive the chickenpox vaccine as a combination vaccine that also protects against [measles](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8584-measles), [mumps](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15007-mumps) and [rubella](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17798-rubella) (called MMRV). It can also be a standalone vaccine.

Adults who haven’t had chickenpox should also get the vaccine. If you’re 13 or older and never got the vaccine, you should get two doses at least 28 days apart.

Vaccination is over 90% effective at preventing chickenpox. Since 1995, the vaccine has prevented at least 91 million cases of chickenpox.

#### Who shouldn’t get the chickenpox vaccine?

There are people who shouldn’t get the chickenpox vaccine. You shouldn't get the chickenpox vaccine if you:

  * Are allergic to the vaccine or to any part of the vaccine.
  * Are pregnant or think you might be pregnant.
  * Have problems with your immune system.
  * Have [tuberculosis](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/11301-tuberculosis).
  * Aren’t feeling well. (Get the vaccine when you feel better.)
  * Recently had a [blood transfusion](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/14755-blood-transfusion) or any other live-attenuated [vaccines](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/21531-antivirals).



## Outlook / Prognosis

### Can adults get chickenpox if they had it as a child?

When children get chickenpox, their bodies fight the illness by making a substance called [antibodies](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22971-antibodies). The antibodies fight the virus and help their body get well. These antibodies stay in your body throughout your life. So, if you come in contact with the virus as an adult, the antibodies are there to fight the virus off.

#### Can you get chicken pox twice?

It’s rare for anyone to get chickenpox twice, but it can happen.

#### What is the oldest you can be to get chickenpox?

There really isn’t an age limit to when you can still get chickenpox. Adults who didn’t have chickenpox as a child and who haven’t had a vaccine can still get chickenpox in their 80s or 90s.

### When can my child go back to school after chickenpox?

Your child can go back to school about seven to 10 days after the rash appears. You don’t need to wait for the scabs to go away completely, but you do need to wait until all the blisters have scabbed over. You’re contagious while the blisters have fluid.

## Living With

### When should you call your healthcare provider if your child has chickenpox?

Call your healthcare provider if your child has any of the following symptoms:

  * Severe headache or fever that doesn’t go away.
  * Sores in their eyes.
  * Sores that get bigger or have yellow pus in them.
  * Difficulty breathing or breathing very fast.
  * Stiff neck or muscle/joint stiffness.
  * Has trouble waking up.



#### When should adults with chickenpox seek medical care?

Chickenpox can be more serious in adults. You should contact a healthcare provider right away if you believe you have chickenpox, especially if you or someone in your house is pregnant or if you live with someone who has a suppressed immune system.

## Additional Common Questions

### How are shingles and chickenpox related?

In adults, the chickenpox virus can become active again. When that happens, it causes an illness caused by [shingles](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/11036-shingles). People “catch” shingles from their own chickenpox virus. People who have shingles can spread chickenpox to people who haven’t had chickenpox. However, you can’t get shingles unless you’ve had chickenpox.

### A note from Cleveland Clinic

Before there was a vaccine for chickenpox in 1995, the infection led to thousands of hospitalizations and deaths each year. The chickenpox vaccine is over 90% effective at preventing this once-common childhood illness. You can still get chickenpox if you don’t get the vaccine — even as an adult. Talk to your healthcare provider about getting vaccinated if you never had chickenpox. While most cases aren’t serious, you can reduce the risk of getting the virus by receiving a vaccine. Most children receive the chickenpox vaccine as part of their childhood immunizations.
