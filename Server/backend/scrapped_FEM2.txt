Many diets offer benefits that go beyond weight loss. The best programs for losing weight also improve your overall health. The biggest challenge is finding the one that will work for you.

Diets aren’t just for weight loss. While changing your diet can be one of the best ways to lose weight, it can also be a gateway to improving your habits, focusing on your health, and leading a more active lifestyle. 

Yet the sheer number of available diet plans may make it difficult to get started. Different diets will be more suitable, sustainable, and effective for different people.

Some diets aim to curb your appetite to reduce your food intake, while others suggest restricting your intake of calories and either carbs or fat. Some focus more on certain eating patterns and lifestyle changes, rather than on limiting certain foods.

What’s more, many offer health benefits that go beyond weight loss.

Here are the 9 best diet plans to help you improve your overall health.

## 

1. The Mediterranean diet

The [Mediterranean diet](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/mediterranean-diet-meal-plan) has long been considered the gold standard for nutrition, disease prevention, wellness, and longevity. This is based on its nutrition benefits and sustainability. 

### How it works

The Mediterranean diet is based on foods that people in countries like Italy and Greece have traditionally eaten. It is rich in: 

  * vegetables
  * fruits
  * whole grains
  * fish
  * nuts
  * lentils
  * olive oil



Foods such as poultry, eggs, and dairy products are to be eaten in moderation, and red meats are limited.

Additionally, the Mediterranean diet limits: 

  * refined grains
  * trans fats
  * processed meats
  * added sugar
  * other highly processed foods



### Health benefits

This diet’s emphasis on minimally processed foods and plants has been associated with a reduced risk of multiple chronic diseases and increased life expectancy. Studies also show that the Mediterranean diet has a preventive effect against certain cancers ([1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29244059/)).

Though the diet was designed to lower heart disease risk, numerous studies indicate that its plant-based, high unsaturated fat dietary pattern can also aid in weight loss ([2](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11154-020-09579-0)). 

A systematic review analyzing five different studies found that, compared with a low fat diet, the Mediterranean diet resulted in greater weight loss after 1 year. Compared with a low carb diet, it produced similar weight loss results ([3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26721635/)).

One study in more than 500 adults over 12 months found that higher adherence to a Mediterranean diet was associated with double the likelihood of weight loss maintenance ([4](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32436489/)). 

Additionally, the Mediterranean diet encourages eating plenty of antioxidant-rich foods, which may help [combat inflammation](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/anti-inflammatory-diet-101) and oxidative stress by neutralizing free radicals ([5](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31480794/)).

### Other benefits

Recent studies have also found that the Mediterranean diet is associated with decreased risk of mental disorders, including cognitive decline and depression ([6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6723598/)). 

Eating less meat is also associated with a more sustainable diet for the planet.

### Downsides

Since the Mediterranean diet does not put a big emphasis on dairy products, it’s important to make sure you still get enough calcium and vitamin D in your diet.

> **Summary**
> 
> The Mediterranean diet emphasizes eating plenty of fruits, vegetables, fish, and healthy oils while restricting refined and highly processed foods. 
> 
> While it’s not a weight loss diet, studies show that it can promote weight loss and overall health.

## 

2. The DASH diet

Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, or [DASH](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/dash-diet), is an eating plan designed to help treat or prevent high blood pressure, which is clinically known as hypertension.

It emphasizes eating plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats. It is low in salt, red meat, added sugars, and fat.

While the DASH diet is not a weight loss diet, many people report losing weight on it.

### How it works

The DASH diet recommends specific servings of different food groups. The number of servings you are encouraged to eat depends on your daily calorie intake.

For example, each day an average person on the DASH diet would eat about:

  * five servings of vegetables
  * five servings of fruit
  * seven servings of healthy carbs like whole grains
  * two servings of low fat dairy products
  * two servings or fewer of lean meats



In addition, it’s recommended to consume nuts and seeds two to three times per week ([7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482514/)).

### Health benefits

The DASH diet has been shown to reduce blood pressure levels and several heart disease risk factors. Also, it may help lower your risk of breast and colorectal cancers ([7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482514/), [8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26934541), [9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29853430), [10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30235731), [11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26622263)).

Studies show that the DASH diet can also help you lose weight. For example, an analysis of 13 studies found that people on the DASH diet lost more weight over 8–24 weeks than people on a control diet ([12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26990451)).

Another study in adults with obesity over 12 weeks found that the DASH diet helped decrease total body weight, body fat percentage, and absolute fat mass in study participants while preserving muscle strength ([13](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31905920/)).

### Other benefits

In addition to weight loss, the DASH diet may help combat depression symptoms ([14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC7973257/)).

A comparative study over 8 years found that even moderate adherence to the DASH diet was related to lower depression risk ([15](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27335121/)).

### Downsides

While the DASH diet may aid with weight loss and lower blood pressure in individuals with hypertension, there is mixed evidence on [salt intake](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/sodium-per-day) and blood pressure. 

Eating too little salt has been linked to increased insulin resistance, and a low sodium diet isn’t the right choice for everyone. 

A low sodium diet like the DASH diet is more appropriate for individuals with hypertension or other health conditions that benefit from or require sodium restriction ([16](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4731857/)).

More research is needed in this area to understand how a low sodium diet can affect insulin resistance in individuals without hypertension.

> **Summary**
> 
> The DASH diet is a low salt diet that has been shown to aid with weight loss. 
> 
> Studies have also linked it to additional benefits for your heart and reduced risks of other chronic diseases.

## 

3. Plant-based and flexitarian diets

[Vegetarianism and veganism](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vegan-vs-vegetarian) are the most popular versions of plant-based diets, which restrict animal products for health, ethical, and environmental reasons. 

However, more flexible plant-based diets also exist, such as the [flexitarian diet](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/flexitarian-diet-guide). This is a plant-based diet that allows eating animal products in moderation.

### How it works

Typical vegetarian diets restrict meat of all kinds but allow dairy products. Typical vegan diets restrict all animal products, including dairy, butter, and sometimes other byproducts like honey. 

The flexitarian eating plan does not have clear-cut rules or recommendations about calories and macronutrients, so it’s considered more of a lifestyle than a diet. Its principles include: 

  * consuming protein from plants instead of animals
  * eating mostly fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains
  * eating the least processed, most natural forms of foods
  * limiting sugar and sweets



Additionally, it allows the flexibility to consume meat and animal products from time to time. 

### Health benefits

Numerous studies have shown that plant-based diets can reduce your risk of developing chronic diseases, including improved markers of metabolic health, decreased blood pressure, and reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. They can also help you lose weight ([17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3662288)).

Flexitarian diets have also been shown to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes and improve metabolic health and blood pressure, plus may have their own weight loss benefits. ([18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC5216044/#:~:text=The%20present%20paper%20has%20identified,pressure%20\(Table%20%E2%80%8B2\).)).

### Other benefits

For those who are looking to lead a sustainable lifestyle, decreasing your meat consumption can also reduce greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and soil degradation ([19](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019566632100550X)).

### Downsides

Plant-based eating patterns like vegetarianism and veganism can sometimes be difficult to maintain and may feel restricting, especially if you’re switching from a more meat-based eating style. 

And while the flexibility of the flexitarian diet makes it easy to follow, being too flexible with it may counteract its benefits.

> **Summary**
> 
> Plant-based diets like veganism and vegetarianism can have real health benefits, such as a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. However, they can also feel restricting for some people. 
> 
> The flexitarian diet is a less strict version of a plant-based diet that allows for minimal meat and animal product consumption. 

## 

4. The MIND diet

The Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet combines aspects of the Mediterranean and DASH diets to create an eating pattern that focuses on brain health.

### How it works

Like the flexitarian diet, the [MIND diet](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/mind-diet) does not have a strict meal plan, but instead encourages eating 10 specific foods with brain health benefits.

Per week, MIND includes eating: 

  * six or more servings of green, leafy vegetables
  * one serving of non-starchy vegetables
  * five or more servings of nuts



Other foods it encourages multiple times a week include: 

  * berries
  * beans
  * olive oil
  * whole grains
  * fish
  * poultry



### Health benefits

Research shows that the MIND diet may reduce a person’s risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease, and studies show that the MIND diet is superior to other plant-rich diets for improving cognition ([20](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34334393/), [21](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33989093/)).

Research also shows that the MIND diet can help slow cognitive decline and improve resiliency in older adults ([22](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26086182)).

It may also help delay the onset of the movement disorder Parkinson’s disease ([23](https://movementdisorders.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mds.28464)).

There is little research concerning the MIND diet and weight loss. Yet, since it is a combination of two diets that promote weight loss, the MIND diet may also help you lose weight.

One way it can help promote weight loss is that it encourages limiting your consumption of foods like: 

  * butter
  * cheese
  * red meat
  * fried food
  * sweets



However, more research needs to be done concerning the MIND diet and weight loss.

### Other benefits

By combining the best of two diets, the MIND diet has a lot to offer and offers some more flexibility than stricter diets.

While you can eat more than the 10 food groups it recommends, the closer you stick to the diet, the better your results may be. 

> **Summary**
> 
> The MIND diet combines aspects of the Mediterranean and DASH diets and may help reduce your risk of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. 
> 
> However, more research needs to be done to evaluate its ability to help you lose weight.

5. WW (formerly Weight Watchers)

WW, formerly [Weight Watchers](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/weight-watchers-diet-review), is one of the most popular weight loss programs worldwide.

While it doesn’t restrict any food groups, people on a WW plan must eat within their set number of daily points to help them reach their ideal weight ([24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28437597)).

### How it works

WW is a points-based system that assigns different foods and beverages a value, depending on their calorie, fat, and fiber contents.

As you work to reach your desired weight, you must stay within your daily point allowance.

### Health benefits

Many studies show that the WW program can help you lose weight ([25](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26890171)).

For example, a review of 45 studies found that people who followed a WW diet lost 2.6% more weight than people who received standard counseling ([26](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25844997)).

What’s more, people who follow WW programs have been shown to be more successful at maintaining weight loss after several years, compared with those who follow other diets ([27](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28478041), [28](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25387778)).

### Other benefits

WW allows flexibility, which makes it easy to follow. This enables people with dietary restrictions, such as those with [food allergies](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/common-food-allergies), to adhere to the plan.

### Downsides

While it allows for flexibility, WW can be costly depending on the subscription plan and the length of time you intend to follow it.

Studies show that it may take up to 52 weeks to produce significant weight loss and clinical benefits ([27](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28478041/)). 

Additionally, its flexibility can be a downfall if dieters choose unhealthy foods.

> **Summary**

6. Intermittent fasting

Intermittent fasting is a dietary strategy that cycles between periods of fasting and eating.

[Various forms exist](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/6-ways-to-do-intermittent-fasting), including the 16/8 method, which involves limiting your calorie intake to 8 hours per day. There’s also the 5:2 method, which restricts your daily calorie intake to 500–600 calories twice per week.

While it’s primarily known as a diet for weight loss, [intermittent fasting](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/intermittent-fasting-guide) may have powerful benefits for both your body and brain.

### How it works

Intermittent fasting restricts the time you’re allowed to eat, which is a simple way to reduce your calorie intake. This can lead to weight loss — unless you compensate by eating too much food during allowed eating periods.

### Health benefits

Intermittent fasting has been linked to anti-aging effects, increased insulin sensitivity, improved brain health, reduced inflammation, and many other benefits ([29](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34633860/), [30](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC8470960/)).

Both animal and human studies show that intermittent fasting may also increase heart health and extend lifespan ([31](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7415631/), [32,](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413118305126) [33](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC8558421/)).

It can also help you lose weight.

In a review of studies, intermittent fasting was shown to cause 0.8–13% weight loss over a period of 2 weeks to 1 year. This is a significantly greater percentage than many other methods ([34](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32060194/)).

Other studies found that intermittent fasting can increase fat burning while preserving muscle mass, which can improve metabolism ([35](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5064803/), [36](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5783752/)).

### Other benefits

While certain diets can have a lot of rules, require frequent trips to the grocery store, and can be difficult to follow, intermittent fasting is known as a more simple-to-follow eating plan.

Due to the nature of the diet, there are fewer meals that you need to prepare, cook, and clean up after.

### Downsides

In general, intermittent fasting is safe for most healthy adults.

That said, those sensitive to drops in their blood sugar levels should talk with a health professional before starting intermittent fasting. These groups include people:

  * who have diabetes
  * who have low weight
  * who have an eating disorder
  * who are pregnant 
  * who are breastfeeding or chestfeeding



> ****Summary****
> 
> Intermittent fasting cycles between periods of fasting and eating. 
> 
> It has been shown to aid with weight loss and is linked to many other health benefits.

7. The Volumetrics diet

The Volumetrics diet was created by Penn State University nutrition professor Barbara Rolls and is meant to be a long-term lifestyle change rather than a strict diet. 

### How it works

The eating plan is designed to promote weight loss by having you fill up on nutrient-dense foods that are low in calories and high in water.

Meanwhile, it limits calorie-dense foods like cookies, candies, nuts, seeds, and oils.

The [Volumetrics diet](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/volumetrics-diet#how-it-works) divides food into four categories based on food’s calorie density, which can be calculated with a formula created by Rolls. These categories are:

  * **Category one:** includes foods of very low calorie density, like non-starchy fruits and vegetables, nonfat milk, and broth-based soup
  * **Category two:** includes low calorie-dense foods, like starchy fruits and vegetables, grains, breakfast cereal, low fat meat, legumes, and low fat mixed dishes like chili
  * **Category three:** includes medium calorie-dense foods, like meat, cheese, pizza, bread, and ice cream
  * **Category four:** includes high calorie-dense foods, like crackers, chips, chocolate candies, nuts, butter, and oil



Meals on the Volumetric diet consist mostly of foods from categories one and two, with limited amounts of food from categories three and four. 

No foods are completely off-limits on the Volumetrics diet, and exercise is encouraged for at least 30–60 minutes each day.

### Health benefits

The Volumetrics diet encourages nutritious foods that are low in calories but high in fiber, vitamins, and minerals, which may help increase your intake of key nutrients and protect against [nutritional deficiencies](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/7-common-nutrient-deficiencies).

Research also links diets with a low calorie density to improved diet quality ([37](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27751190/)).

Additionally, it limits the amount of processed foods you’ll eat, which can decrease your risk of developing certain cancers and heart disease ([38](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29444771/), [39](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6538975/)).

The Volumetrics diet may also help you lose weight. 

A review of 13 studies in more than 3,000 people found that diets rich in low calorie density foods led to increased weight loss. Similarly, an 8-year study in more than 50,000 women found that high calorie-dense foods led to increased weight gain ([40](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4848697/), [41](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18779295/)).

### Downsides

While the Volumetrics diet may be effective for health benefits and weight loss, it requires a good understanding of Volumetrics, which involves learning about the calorie levels of foods in relation to portion sizes and nutrient levels.

This may be easier for some compared to others.

> **Summary**
> 
> The Volumetrics is designed to promote weight loss by having you fill up on nutrient-dense foods that are low in calories and high in water. 
> 
> While it may help you lose weight, it requires a good understanding of Volumetrics and the calorie levels of foods.

8. The Mayo Clinic Diet

The [Mayo Clinic Diet](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/mayo-clinic-diet#the-diet) was created by the reputable medical organization of the same name.

### How it works

Designed to be a lifestyle change over a quick fix, the Mayo Clinic Diet focuses on replacing less healthy behaviors with ones that are more likely to support longevity and weight loss.

Rather than banning certain foods, the Mayo Clinic Diet uses a pyramid to encourage exercise and illustrate quantities of foods you should be consuming. 

Fruits, vegetables, and physical activity make up the base of the pyramid, followed by carbs in the next layer, then protein and dairy, fats, and finally, sweets.

The diet consists of two phases. An initial, 2-week phase designed to kick-start your weight loss by introducing 5 healthier habits and encouraging you to break 5 common less healthy habits. 

The second phase is more of a lifestyle change designed to be followed long-term, encouraging education about nutritious food choices and portion sizes in addition to being physically active.

### Health benefits

Little research is available about the health benefits of the Mayo Clinic Diet.

However, the Mayo Clinic tells users to expect about 10 pounds of weight loss during the first 2 weeks, and up to 2 pounds during the second phase. 

Since diets rich in fiber can increase satiety by making you feel more full, the Mayo Clinic Diet may contribute to weight loss. It may also decrease your risk of developing type 2 diabetes ([42](https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/147/11/2060/4743220)).

Additionally, studies show that exercising while on a lower-calorie diet is more effective at promoting weight loss than dieting alone ([43](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4429709/)). 

However, more research is needed to determine the effectiveness of the Mayo Clinic Diet for weight loss.

### Downsides

While the digital version of the program includes meal plans, recipes, a food tracker, virtual group sessions, at-home workouts, and more, it will cost you monthly to buy into the program.

> **Summary**
> 
> The Mayo Clinic Diet utilizes an easy-to-follow pyramid to encourage exercise and a diet rich in fruits and vegetables. 
> 
> While creators tell followers of the diet to expect about 10 pounds of weight loss during the first 2 weeks, more research needs to be done to fully understand its health benefits.

9. Low carb diets

Low carb diets are among the most popular diets for weight loss. Examples include the Atkins diet, ketogenic (keto) diet, and low carb, high fat (LCHF) diet.

[Some varieties](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/8-popular-ways-to-do-low-carb) reduce carbs more drastically than others. For instance, very low carb diets like the keto diet restrict this macronutrient to under 10% of total calories, compared with 30% or less for other types ([44](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537084/)).

### How it works

Low carb diets restrict your carb intake in favor of protein and fat.

They’re typically higher in protein than low fat diets, which is important, as protein can help curb your appetite, raise your metabolism, and conserves muscle mass ([45](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25926512)).

In very low carb diets like keto, your body begins using fatty acids rather than carbs for energy by converting them into ketones. This process is called [ketosis](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-signs-and-symptoms-of-ketosis) ([46](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31825066/)).

### Health benefits

Research suggests that low carb diets may reduce risk factors for heart disease, including high cholesterol and blood pressure levels. They may also improve blood sugar and insulin levels in people with type 2 diabetes ([47](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC6959586/), [48](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29269890)).

Many studies indicate that low carb diets can aid weight loss and may be more effective than conventional low fat diets ([49](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26527511), [50](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25178568), [51](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26393645)).

For example, a review of 53 studies made up of 68,128 participants found that low carb diets resulted in significantly more weight loss than low fat diets ([52](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26527511)).

What’s more, low carb diets appear to be quite effective at burning harmful belly fat ([53](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25527677), [54](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29986720), [55](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25682064)).

### Downsides

In some cases, a low carb diet may raise LDL (bad) cholesterol levels. Very low carb diets can also be difficult to follow and cause digestive upset in some people ([56](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30408717)).

In very rare situations, following a very low carb diet may cause a condition known as ketoacidosis, a dangerous metabolic condition that can be fatal if left untreated ([57](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26428083), [58](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28883241)).

> **Summary**
> 
> Low carb diets restrict your carb intake, which encourages your body to use more fat as fuel. 
> 
> They can help you lose weight and offer many other benefits.

Frequently asked questions

### What is the very best diet plan?

There isn’t one diet that can be said to be the best. Many diets can [help you lose weight](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-to-lose-weight-as-fast-as-possible) and offer unique health benefits. 

Some of the most popular eating plans include the Mediterranean diet, WW (Weight Watchers), the MIND diet, the DASH diet, intermittent fasting, plant-based diets, low-carb diets, the Mayo Clinic Diet, and the Volumetrics diet.

### Which diet is most successful for weight loss?

While various diets have been shown to be effective for weight loss, the diet you choose should depend on your lifestyle and food preferences. This ensures that you are more likely to stick to it in the long term. That said, what diet works for you may also depend on your body and overall state of health.

### How can I lose 20 pounds in a month?

While it may be possible to shed twenty lbs in a month, this isn’t recommended. A safer and more manageable approach to weight loss is to focus on gradually losing weight through a combination of a balanced diet and exercise. This will help you remain healthy while keeping the weight off in the long run.

The bottom line

Dieting isn’t just about weight loss. Many diets provide additional health benefits. To get the best outcome, you need to find the program that works for your particular needs. The biggest difficulty is discovering which one that will be.

Before starting any kind of new diet, it’s always a good idea to talk with your doctor about your personal health history. They can help you decide which plan would work best for you. 

Once you’ve decided to start a new diet, a registered dietitian can help you navigate the new rules and help you plan meals that you actually want to eat.

If you have kidney stones, you may need to follow a special diet plan. First, your healthcare professional will run blood and urine tests to find out what kind of risk factors you may have. Then your healthcare professional will tell you the diet changes and medical treatment you need to prevent having kidney stones come back.

A registered kidney dietitian can help you make the necessary changes in your diet plan and lifestyle.

## What is a kidney stone?

A kidney stone is a hard mass that forms from crystals in the urine. For most people, natural chemicals in the urine keep stones from forming and causing problems.

## Are all kidney stones the same?

No. The most common types of kidney stones are calcium stones followed by uric acid stones. Diet changes and medical treatment are individualized based on the type of stone, to prevent them from coming back.

## What is the most important factor to prevent kidney stone formation?

One of the best things you can do to avoid kidney stones is to drink plenty of water every day. This will help make sure that you urinate frequently to avoid any build up of calcium or uric acid.

Don't underestimate your sweat! Saunas, hot yoga and heavy exercise may sound good for your health, but they also may lead to kidney stones. Why? Loss of water through sweating whether due to these activities or just the heat of summer may lead to less urine production. The more you sweat, the less you will urinate, which allows stone-causing minerals to settle and deposit in the kidneys and urinary tract.

Hydrate with water. Be sure to keep well hydrated, especially when doing exercise or activities that cause a lot of sweating. You should drink 2-3 quarts of liquid or 8-12 cups per day to produce a good amount of urine. Speak with a healthcare professional about the right amount of water that's best for you. Try to avoid sodas (especially those with high amounts of fructose), sweetened iced tea and grapefruit juice.

## What kind of diet plan is recommended to prevent stones?

There is no single diet plan for stone prevention. Most diet recommendations are based on stone types and individualized for each person.

**1. Calcium Oxalate Stones: most common stones**

Oxalate is naturally found in many foods, including fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds, grains, legumes, and even chocolate and tea. Some examples of foods that have high levels of oxalate include peanuts, rhubarb, spinach, beets, Swiss chard, chocolate and sweet potatoes. Limiting intake of these foods may be beneficial for people who form calcium oxalate stones which is the leading type of kidney stone.

Eat and drink calcium foods such as milk, yogurt, and some cheese and oxalate-rich foods together during a meal. The oxalate and calcium from the foods are more likely to bind to one another in the stomach and intestines before entering the kidneys. This will make it less likely that kidney stones will form.

Calcium is not the enemy but it tends to get a bad rap! This is most likely due to its name and misunderstanding that calcium is the main cause in calcium-oxalate stones. A diet low in calcium actually increases your chances of developing kidney stones.

Don't reduce the calcium in your diet. Work to cut back on the sodium in your diet and to pair calcium-rich foods with oxalate-rich foods. The recommended calcium intake to prevent calcium stones is 1000-1200 mg per day (you can eat 3 servings of dairy products with meals to meet the recommendation).

Extra sodium causes you to lose more calcium in your urine. Sodium and calcium share the same transport in the kidney so if you eat high sodium foods it will increase calcium leakage in the urine. Therefore, a high sodium diet can increase your chances for developing another stone. There are many sources of "hidden" sodium such as canned or commercially processed foods as well as restaurant-prepared and fast foods.

You can lower your sodium intake by choosing fresh low sodium foods which can help to lower calcium leakage in the urine and will also help with blood pressure control if you have high blood pressure.

**2. Uric acid stones: another common stone**

Red meat, organ meats, and shellfish have high amounts of a natural chemical compound known as purines. High purine intake leads to a higher production of uric acid and a larger acid load for the kidneys to excrete. Higher uric acid excretion leads to more acidic urine. The high acid concentration of the urine makes it easier for uric acid stones to form.

To prevent uric acid stones, cut down on high-purine foods such as red meat, organ meats, beer/alcoholic beverages, meat-based gravies, sardines, anchovies and shellfish. Follow a healthy diet plan that has mostly vegetables and fruits, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products. Limit sugar-sweetened foods and drinks, especially those that have high fructose corn syrup. Limit alcohol because it can increase uric acid levels in the blood and avoid short term diets for the same reason. Decreasing animal-based protein and eating more fruits and vegetables will help decrease urine acidity and this may help reduce the chance for uric acid stone formation.

## Will it help or hurt to take a vitamin or mineral supplement?

The B vitamins which include thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, B6 and B12 have not been shown to be harmful to people with kidney stones. In fact, some studies have shown that B6 may actually help people with high urine oxalate. However, it is best to check with your healthcare professional or dietitian for advice on the use of vitamin C, vitamin D, fish liver oils or other mineral supplements containing calcium since some supplements can increase the chances of stone formation in some individuals.

## Diet Recommendations for Kidney Stones

### General Recommendations

  1. **Drink plenty of fluid: 2-3 quarts/day**
     * This includes any type of fluid such as water, coffee and lemonade which have been shown to have a beneficial effect with the exception of grapefruit juice and soda.
     * This will help produce less concentrated urine and ensure a good urine volume of at least**2.5L/day**
  2. **Limit foods with high oxalate content**
     * Spinach, many berries, chocolate, wheat bran, nuts, beets, tea and rhubarb should be eliminated from your diet intake
  3. **Eat enough dietary calcium**
     * Three servings of dairy per day will help lower the risk of calcium stone formation. Eat with meals.
  4. **Avoid extra calcium supplements**
     * Calcium supplements should be individualized by your physician and registered kidney dietitian
  5. **Eat a moderate amount of protein**
     * High protein intakes will cause the kidneys to excrete more calcium therefore this may cause more stones to form in the kidney
  6. **Avoid high salt intake**
     * High sodium intake increases calcium in the urine which increases the chances of developing stones
     * Low salt diet is also important to control blood pressure.
  7. **Avoid high doses of vitamin C supplements**
     * It is recommend to take 60mg/day of vitamin C based on the US Dietary Reference Intake
     * Excess amounts of 1000mg/day or more may produce more oxalate in the body

## Description of the DASH Eating Plan

The DASH eating plan requires no special foods and instead provides daily and weekly nutritional goals. This plan recommends:

  * Eating vegetables, fruits, and whole grains
  * Including fat-free or low-fat dairy products, fish, poultry, beans, nuts, and vegetable oils
  * Limiting foods that are high in saturated fat, such as fatty meats, full-fat dairy products, and tropical oils such as coconut, palm kernel, and palm oils
  * Limiting sugar-sweetened beverages and sweets



**Based on these recommendations, the following table shows examples of daily and weekly servings that meet DASH eating plan targets for a**[**2,000-calorie-a-day**](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/resources/whats-your-plate-1800-2000-caloriesday)**diet.**

**Food Group**| **Daily Servings**  
---|---  
Grains| 6–8  
Meats, poultry, and fish| 6 or less  
Vegetables| 4–5  
Fruit| 4–5  
Low-fat or fat-free dairy products| 2–3  
Fats and oils| 2–3  
Sodium| 2,300 mg*  
 **Weekly Servings**  
Nuts, seeds, dry beans, and peas| 4–5  
Sweets| 5 or less  
  
*1,500 milligrams (mg) [ sodium ](# "Definition of sodium ") lowers blood pressure even further than 2,300 mg sodium daily.

When following the DASH eating plan, it is important to choose foods that are:

  * Low in saturated and _trans_ fats
  * Rich in potassium, calcium, magnesium, fiber, and protein
  * Lower in sodium



The number of servings you should have each day depends on your daily calorie needs. Use these worksheets to see how your current eating habits compare to DASH. Find what counts as a serving size and more:

## DASH diet: Healthy eating to lower your blood pressure

 _

Discover how DASH can help you lower your blood pressure and improve your health.

_[By Mayo Clinic Staff](/about-this-site/meet-our-medical-editors)

DASH stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension.

The DASH diet is a healthy-eating plan designed to help prevent or treat high blood pressure, also called hypertension. It also may help lower cholesterol linked to heart disease, called low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.

High blood pressure and high LDL cholesterol levels are two major risk factors for heart disease and stroke.

Foods in the DASH diet are rich in the minerals potassium, calcium and magnesium. The DASH diet focuses on vegetables, fruits and whole grains. It includes fat-free or low-fat dairy products, fish, poultry, beans and nuts.

The diet limits foods that are high in salt, also called sodium. It also limits added sugar and saturated fat, such as in fatty meats and full-fat dairy products.

### DASH diet and sodium

The standard DASH diet limits salt to 2,300 milligrams (mg) a day. That amount agrees with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. That's about the amount of sodium in 1 teaspoon of table salt.

A lower sodium version of DASH restricts sodium to 1,500 mg a day. You can choose the version of the diet that meets your health needs. If you aren't sure what sodium level is right for you, talk to your health care provider.

### DASH diet: What to eat

The DASH diet is a balanced eating plan that gives choices of what to eat. The diet helps create a heart-healthy eating style for life. There's no need for special foods or drinks. Foods in the diet are at grocery stores and in most restaurants.

When following DASH, it is important to choose foods that are:

  * Rich in potassium, calcium, magnesium, fiber and protein.
  * Low in saturated fat.
  * Low in salt.



### DASH diet: Suggested servings

The DASH diet provides daily and weekly nutritional goals. The number of servings depends on daily calorie needs.

Here's a look at the recommended servings from each food group for a 2,000-calorie-a-day DASH diet:

  * **Grains: 6 to 8 servings a day.** One serving may be 1/2 cup of cooked cereal, rice or pasta, 1 slice of bread or 1 ounce dry cereal.
  * **Vegetables: 4 to 5 servings a day.** One serving is 1 cup raw leafy green vegetable, 1/2 cup cut-up raw or cooked vegetables, or 1/2 cup vegetable juice.
  * **Fruits: 4 to 5 servings a day.** One serving is one medium fruit, 1/2 cup fresh, frozen or canned fruit, or 1/2 cup fruit juice.
  * **Fat-free or low-fat dairy products: 2 to 3 servings a day.** One serving is 1 cup milk or yogurt, or 1 1/2 ounces cheese.
  * **Lean meats, poultry and fish: six 1-ounce servings or fewer a day.** One serving is 1 ounce of cooked meat, poultry or fish, or 1 egg.
  * **Nuts, seeds, or dry beans and peas: 4 to 5 servings a week.** One serving is 1/3 cup nuts, 2 tablespoons peanut butter, 2 tablespoons seeds, or 1/2 cup cooked dried beans or peas, also called legumes.
  * **Fats and oils: 2 to 3 servings a day.** One serving is 1 teaspoon soft margarine, 1 teaspoon vegetable oil, 1 tablespoon mayonnaise or 2 tablespoons salad dressing.
  * **Sweets and added sugars: 5 servings or fewer a week.** One serving is 1 tablespoon sugar, jelly or jam, 1/2 cup sorbet or 1 cup lemonade.



### DASH diet: Alcohol and caffeine

Drinking too much alcohol can increase blood pressure. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that men limit alcohol to no more than two drinks a day and women to one or less.

The DASH diet doesn't talk about caffeine. How caffeine affects blood pressure isn't clear. But caffeine can cause blood pressure to rise at least briefly.

If you have high blood pressure or if you think caffeine affects your blood pressure, think about cutting down. You might talk to your health care provider about caffeine.

### Take aim at salt

The foods at the center of the DASH diet are low in salt. So following the DASH diet is likely to lower salt intake.

To further reduce salt:

  * Read food labels and choose low-salt or no-salt-added options.
  * Use salt-free spices or flavorings instead of salt.
  * Don't add salt when cooking rice, pasta or hot cereal.
  * Choose plain fresh or frozen vegetables.
  * Choose fresh skinless poultry, fish and lean cuts of meat.
  * Eat less restaurant food. When eating at restaurants, ask for dishes with less salt and ask not to have salt added to your order.



As you cut back on processed, salty foods, you might notice that food tastes different. It can take time for your taste buds to adjust. But once they do, you might prefer the DASH way of eating. And you'll be healthier for it.

# The Difference Between a Diet Plan and an Nutritional Plan

When looking for a healthy, sustainable way to lose weight, you’re bound to stumble across terms like _diet plan_ or _nutritional program_. Diet plans and nutritional programs can help you lose or maintain your weight, but what are the differences between them?

CardioMender, MD Weight Loss Specialists, will guide you on how to gain control over your weight by embracing new eating habits with a responsible nutritional program. Our cardiologist-supervised [weight loss programs](https://www.cardiomenderweightloss.com/weight-loss-program/) have helped thousands of people achieve a healthy weight and maintain a fulfilling life.

## Diet Plan vs. Nutritional Program

### What Is a Diet Plan?

By definition, a diet is a temporary restriction from certain foods to reduce one’s weight, like a strategy or blueprint for achieving weight reduction. Diet plans can be tailored to your specific health status and weight loss goals but not specifically to sustaining it.

### What Is a Nutritional Program?

A nutritional program is a more detailed, comprehensive plan and record of what you consume every day, composed of the items in your breakfast, lunch, snacks, and dinner. Nutrition programs teach you how to embrace nutritionally balanced eating habits which result in weight loss that is sustainable.

### The Difference Between Nutritional Plans and Diets

Unlike a traditional weight loss diet plan, nutrition plans outline the various foods and respective portions to consume at certain times of the day. A nutrition plan (also called a “meal plan”) is a weight-loss tool emphasizing variety and choice in your meals and how to schedule those choices throughout your day, whereas diet plans most commonly focus on caloric intake.

Nutritional plans are preferred for long-term weight loss because they support focusing on habitually choosing nutrient-rich foods and addressing supplemental health factors, all designed to achieve sustained results. Breaking your daily intake into blocks, such as water consumption, breakfast, snacks, lunch, and dinner, helps individuals understand and formulate the best strategies for their weight loss journey, with support and guidance from their nutritional specialist.

## What is a Healthy Diet Plan?

Every person has a slightly different physiology, and there is no one-size-fits-all healthy diet plan that works for everyone. A healthy diet plan considers an individual’s lifestyle and general physiology, but following a healthy diet plan may mean depriving yourself of the foods you love.

## What is a Healthy Nutritional Plan?

A healthy nutrition plan can help you manage your health and weight. But what does a healthy nutrition plan entail? A healthy nutrition plan does not revolve around the number of calories you need daily. It goes beyond your usual eating habits and focuses on better nourishment. It is far more important to balance the protein, fat, and glycemic load (carbs) so that you do not have to constantly measure or weigh your food. This balance is an important part of the CardioMender, MD program until you become more metabolically, physiologically, and behaviorally balanced. Ultimately, a nutritional plan, once fully incorporated, leads to a fundamental shift in a person’s nutritional preferences and hence behavioral shifts lead to a stable healthy weight breaking the weight loss/weight gain rollercoaster ride.

A healthy nutritional plan can help you plan your daily meals and ensure that everything on your plate is naturally rich in nutrients while low in unhealthy fat and calories. You can attain a balanced diet and ensure that the meals you serve on your plate have all the nutrients your body requires while staying within your daily intake targets for weight loss. A healthy meal plan incorporates whole foods, fruits, and veggies, which leads to a stable ideal weight and optimal health specific to the individual.

At CardioMender, MD, each of our patient-specific nutritional plans is transformative. As each patient passes various weight loss milestones (benchmarks), a variety of adjustments or plan step-ups are made that ultimately lead to a Maintenance Nutritional Plan. This Maintenance Nutritional Plan is designed to remain within a five-pound radius of the individual’s target weight and optimal health.

Each step of the way, our patients lose weight and achieve progressive wellness, as evidenced by the improvement in various biometric indices, all of which lead to sustainable weight loss, improved health and wellness, and improvement in how our patients look and feel.

## Why Most Diets Don’t Work

There are many reasons why a diet might not work for an individual. However, that may not be a failure on their part:

  * The purpose of most diets is to help people lose weight quickly rather than to assist them in developing a healthy lifestyle. After a short time, the desired benefits are mostly gone.
  * [Most diets don’t work for the vast majority of people](https://www.cardiomenderweightloss.com/diet-plans-dont-work/). Instead of encouraging a reasonable and sustainable lifestyle change, they focus on the types or amounts of food you can consume for a set period, after which you are free to eat what you please.
  * Dieting rarely works in the long run. Sure, diets assist people in losing weight quickly but fail to provide the knowledge so that individuals can build sustainable healthy patterns and habits; thus, the weight usually creeps back on again.



In addition to the reasons for failure listed above, diet plans may also produce feelings of deprivation, are difficult to sustain, and can leave you feeling full of guilt, shame, and failure after a cheat, which in turn, leads to giving up before desired results are achieved.

On a positive note, nutritional programs help you embrace and transition to nutritionally balanced eating and provide feelings of satiety and satisfaction. There can also be planned deviations for special occasions, vacations, and other significant events, after which resuming these newly embraced eating habits immediately upon returning to a typical daily routine. Cut yourself some slack, and keep the faith.

CardioMender, MD, focuses on [weight loss programs](https://www.cardiomenderweightloss.com/weight-loss-program/) that will succeed and result in sustainable weight management. CardioMender’s maintenance program provides support and guidance after weight loss goals have been achieved to address any future challenges that may arise. We believe that healthy eating and living should be a priority and that a sustainable lifestyle is attainable for all our patients.
